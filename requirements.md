1. Python Version:

    Python 3.x

2. Python Modules:

    The script uses several Python standard libraries:
        argparse
        requests
        sys
        json
        os
        concurrent.futures
        datetime
        urllib.parse (for parsing URLs)
        
    The only non-standard library used is requests, which you might need to install.

3. Dependencies:

    requests: To install it, run:

     pip install requests

4. API Key (Optional):

    If you plan to use the VirusTotal functionality, you'll need a VirusTotal API key:
        Set it as an environment variable:

    export VT_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

Or include it directly in the script (not recommended for security reasons).
